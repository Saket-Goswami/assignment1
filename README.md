## 🧮 Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations (`task1.py`)

This script performs **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** on two numbers entered by the user.

### 🔹 Features:
- Takes two numeric inputs
- Performs basic arithmetic operations
- Handles division by zero safely
- Displays all results clearly in the console

### 💻 Example Run:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0
```

### 🧠 Concepts Used:
- `input()` for user input  
- `float()` for type conversion  
- Conditional (ternary) expression for safe division  
- Formatted strings (`f-strings`)

## 👋 Task 2: Full Name Greeting Program (`task2.py`)

This program asks the user for their **first** and **last** name, then combines and displays a personalized greeting message.

### 🔹 Features:
- Takes two string inputs
- Combines them into a full name
- Prints a friendly greeting message

### 💻 Example Run:
```
Enter your first name: Saket
Enter your last name: Goswami

Hello, Saket Goswami! Welcome to the Python program.
```

### 🧠 Concepts Used:
- String concatenation  
- Input and output operations  
- Formatted output using f-strings
